# Income Page Features

## Overview
The Income page allows users to track their earnings, both recurring and one-off, and visualize their income trends.

## Key Functionalities

### 1. Add Recurring Income
- Users should be able to define income sources that occur regularly (e.g., monthly salary, rental income).
- Ability to specify:
    - Income source name/description.
    - Amount.
    - Frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).
    - Start date.
    - End date (optional).

### 2. Add One-Off Manual Income
- Users should be able to record income that is not regular (e.g., bonus, freelance project payment, gift).
- Ability to specify:
    - Income source name/description.
    - Amount.
    - Date received.

### 3. Income Visualization
- A graph (e.g., line chart, bar chart) should display:
    - **Actual Income**: Sum of all recorded income (both recurring and one-off) over time.
    - **Projected Income**: Calculated based on recurring income entries, showing expected future earnings.
- The graph should allow users to view trends over different periods (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly).

## Data Considerations
- Income data should be securely stored.
- Projections should be clearly distinguished from actual, historical data.
